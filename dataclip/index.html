    <h2>What is a DataClip?</h2>

    <p>DataClip is the name for both a propsed wearable sensor devise standard, and the process it would use to "clip" sensitive data to protect privacy. DataClips capture anonymous data for Smart City models using 3D data collected from multiple perspectives. 

      The proposed AI data clipping process would remove text, audio, video and 3D spatial data that reveals identities.

      Data flagged as private would be encrypted using Privacy-Preserving Face Recognition.[1] The shared city data model would generate crowds and traffic 
      approximating the quanities in the original video and 3D spatial photography.<br><br>



    <!--  independent of government and private organizations. -->
    Individuals would have the option to decrypt data related to themselves. 

    A committee of peers with multiple decryption keys would have the opportunity to decrypt a source file in the event of a crime.

    <h2>A Brief History of Public-Facing Mobile Sensors</h2>

    <p>Most mobile sensors worn by individuals track their own biometrics. For exaples, FitWit records walking and heartrate. The typical mobile sensor doesn't record data from the people and locations around you. In contrast, the following sensors are designed to capture information from your surrounding environment, hands-free.</p><br>

    <p><b>Narrative Clip 2012 to 2016 - Consumer focused "Life-Logging" Camera</b></p>

    <div style="float:right; margin-left:60px"><img src="../img/dataclip/narrative-white-clip2-necklace.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 250px"></div>

    <p>
    The Narrative Clip was initiated in 2012 by a $500,000 kickstarter campaign. A small "life-logging" camera automatically took a picture every 30 seconds.
    Narrative shipped 40,000 units of the Narrative 1 and 2 combined.[2] When the company could not attract further financing in 2016, only pre-ordered Narrative 2 units were delivered. The Narrative Clip 2 was packed with new features: video capture, Bluetooth control, a built-in Wifi cloud uploader and modular attachment system.]<br><br>

    At the peak of it's potential, why was the Narative Clip unable to move forward?
       Narrative's CTO stated that the cashflow problems in 2016 were due to a decline in venture capital for wearables. 

      The assests were acquired by some of the former founders and employees, who are now preparing for a relaunch. [3]

<h2>Wearable Spatial Sensors for Construction</h2>

<p><a href="../img/dataclip/wearable-sensors-7C.jpg"><img src="../img/dataclip/wearable-sensors-7C.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 450px; float:right"></a></p>

    <p>
      With a wide range of sensor technogy being combined in novel ways for 
      new forms of mobile sensor devices, the construction industry has a large set of device categories to draw from.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across 42 different categories of wearable devices, optical sensors are anticipated to hold the largest share of the sensor market in 2022. The second largest percentage is three-dimensional inertial measurement units (IMU) tracking force and angular rate measurement units using accelerometers and gyroscopes, often accompanied by magnetometers to provide additional directional data.

    The second largest percentage is three-dimensional inertial measurement units (IMU) tracking force and angular rate using accelerometers and gyroscopes, often with magnetometers to provide additional functionality.

    </p>

    <p>Optical spatial recording devices that produce contribute to real-time 3D models with A.I. are likely to be the most transformative for the 
      consturction industry, allowing software to update BIM status tracking in real-time. A.I will adjust schedules automatically, request shipments, schedule workers will humans view predictive 3D models to watch for anomolies. 
      Spatial AI could largely replace the use of RFID and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) tags by using high-resolution cameras to identify all objects on the construction site by minute details.
       
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Mobile Data Collection for Smart City Models</h2>

    <p>
      Beyond the relm of construction sites, the entire city looms as a prospective 
      source of infrastructure sensor data for Digital Twins modeling on an urban scale.[5]&nbsp;

      <!-- for predicting and improving urban outcomes -->
       As mobile sensors capture data from many vantage points to make predictive models more accurate, we'll need to ensure that we don't sacrifice privacy for safety and extreme accuracy.  For example, an array of construction cameras share real-time 3D spatial data with all the contractors on the site could significantly increase safety.  Without a means to filter out people passing by from shared videos, construction firms could be revealing the whereabouts of thousands of people to their contractors, making the public walking by the site vulnerable to home breakins, blackmail, or embarasment if videos are posted online.

    <h2>Public Acceptance of Being Recorded</h2>
    <p>
        Whether the relaunched Narrative Clip will make a shift to industry and manufacturing as Google Glass did is yet to be seen.  Narrative's loss of funding in 2016 was likely a victim of the public privacy outcry surrouding the privacy infingments of Google Glass cameras in public spaces like restaurants and bars.
        Today Google Glasses have expanded their market within manufacturing, where handsfree training is needed on the factory floor. Emerging competition from simlar clip devices, like the Ion Clip Camera above, may have caused investors to shy away from Narrative. Perhaps a rethink of privacy notification and protection is needed before
        wearing data cature devices in public gains broader acceptance.

      </p>
      <br>

    <h2>Privacy Protection Indicator Colors</h2>

    <p>How can we indicate the type of data capture underway, so near-by individuals 
    are aware of the degree to which their actions are recorded? 
    Perhaps the existing "red" video recording indicator color could be expanded to include more colors for other types of recording.
    </p>

    <p>At the most basic level, identity protected recording (green) would be air quality, humidity and temperature, wind, estimates based on sound, general counts of people, sound level, etc. At the highest level, another color simultaneous to green, would indicate software removal of identity features - blurring or removing people, omitting text and audio snippets.

    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
    <p>
        Like it our not, facial recognition and surveilance are all around us with Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft providing services to individuals, companies and governments.[6,7]&nbsp;
        Through the use of AI driven filters we can use our personal mobility devices to contribute to common data modeling processes that improve our well-being without sacrificing privacy and security.
