    <h2>What is Peer Data Clipping?</h2>

    <p>Peer Data Clipping (PDC) refers to our proposed process of removing sensitive data related to other individuals from shared data streams. The clipping process would allow for privacy protection during peer-to-peer data sharing (of text, audio, video and 3D) for near real-time rendering of Smart City models using 3D data collected from multiple perspectives. Data flagged as private would be encrypted using Privacy-Preserving Face Recognition.[1] The shared city data model would not provide access to identifiable individuals without the use of multiple decryption keys held by a committee of peers. 
    <!--  independent of government and private organizations. -->
    Individuals would have the option to decrypt data related to themselves. 
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2>A Brief History of Public-Facing Mobile Sensors</h2>

    <p>Most mobile sensors worn by individuals track their own biometrics. For exaples, FitWit records walking and heartrate. The typical mobile sensor doesn't record data from the people and locations around you. In contrast, the following sensors are designed to capture information from your surrounding environment, hands-free.</p><br>

    <p><b>Narrative Clip 2012 to 2016 - Consumer focused "Life-Logging" Camera</b></p>

    <div style="float:right; margin-left:60px"><img src="../img/dataclip/narrative-white-clip2-necklace.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 250px"></div>

    <p>
    The Narrative Clip was initiated in 2012 by a $500,000 kickstarter campaign. A small "life-logging" camera automatically took a picture every 30 seconds.
    Narrative shipped 40,000 units of the Narrative 1 and 2 combined.[2] When the company could not attract further financing in 2016, only pre-ordered Narrative 2 units were delivered. The Narrative Clip 2 was packed with new features: video capture, Bluetooth control, a built-in Wifi cloud uploader and modular attachment system.]<br><br>

    Why, at the peak of it's potential, was the Narative Clip unable to move forward?
      "Due to cashflow problems and a broad decline in venture capital interest in wearables during 2016, the original company had to shut down late 2016. The assets and cloud service were acquired by a new company called Third Dot, run by some of the former founders and employees, which is keeping the service running for the existing users as well as maintaining sales of the Clip 2." <!-- To update, from wiki --> [3]

      <!--
       There have been rumours of a Narrative Clip 3 being developed by the new company but no official announcements have been made." - <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Narrative_Clip">Wikipedia</a> (Primary sources to be added.)
      -->
    </p>


    <div style="overflow: auto">
      <p>
      Updates planned by Narrative:<br>
      - Shift from sole focus on consumer to business applications<br>
      - Adding revenue generation from cloud storage<br>
      - New manufacturing partners to restart production<br>
      </p>

      <!--
      <p>
        <b>Why did Narrative Clip hit hardship in 2016?</b><br>
        Was access to funding more challenging following the privacy concerns raised surrounding Google Glasses? Since that time, Google Glasses have gained traction with manufacturing, where handsfree training occurs during production.  Is the near-term future of wearable sensors in industry?

<h2>Wearable Spatial Sensors for Construction</h2>

    <p>
      Across 42 different categories of wearable devices, optical sensors are anticipated to hold the largest share of the sensor market in 2022. The second largest percentage is three-dimensional inertial measurement units (IMU) tracking force and angular rate using accelerometers and gyroscopes, often accompanied by magnetometers to provide additional functionality.

    <h2>Digital Twin Smart City Models</h2>

    <p>
      Beyond the relm of construction sites, the entire city looms as a prospective 
      source of digital infrastructure modeling.[5] Mobile sensors will be an essential data stream for accurate Digital Twin Smart City models. As our data is captured to 
      create more accurate models, we'll need to strike the right balance between 
      too little and too much.

    <h2>Privacy Protection Indicator Colors</h2>

    <p>How can we make the data capture process more transparent, so near-by individuals 
    are comfortable and aware of the degree to which their actions are recorded? 
    Perhaps the existing "red" video recording indicator color could be expanded to include other types of recording.
    </p>

    <p>At the most basic level, identity protected recording (green) would be air quality, humidity and temperature, wind, estimates based on sound, general counts of people, sound level, etc. At the highest level, another color simultaneous to green, would indicate software removal of identity features - blurring or removing people, omitting text and audio snippets.

    <h2>2018 - New Directions for Wearables</h2>

    <p>
      Google has a new version Wear OS (for their smartwatches and other wearables) which feels less like the Android operating system. (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/29/google-wear-os-redesign-2018-hands-on/">engadget.com/2018/08/29</a>)</p><br>

      A thin wearable phone could hang like a conference name tag around one's neck. The phone display could face outward to show custom info to passers-by.

    <br><br>



    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
    <p>
        Like it our not, facial recognition and surveilance are all around us with Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft providing services to individuals, companies and governments.[6,7]&nbsp;
        Through the use of AI driven filters we can use our personal mobility devices to contribute to common data modeling processes that improve our well-being without sacrificing privacy and security.
