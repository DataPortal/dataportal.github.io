    <h1>DataClip Sensors - Privacy Standard Proposal</h1>

    <p>[Intro to be added]</p><br>

    <h2>Narrative Clip 2012 to 2016 - Consumer Focus</h2>

    <div style="float:right; margin-left:60px"><img src="../img/dataclip/narrative-white-clip2-necklace.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 250px"></div>

    <p>
    The Narrative Clip was initiated in 2012 by a $500,000 kickstarter campaign. A small "life-logging" camera automatically took a picture every 30 seconds.
    Narrative shipped 40,000 units of the Narrative 1 and 2 combined. When the company could not attract further financing in 2016, only pre-ordered Narrative 2 units were delivered. The Narrative Clip 2 was packed with new features: video capture, Bluetooth control, a built-in Wifi cloud uploader and modular attachment system. Why, at the peak of it's potential, was the Narative Clip unable to move forward?
    </p>

    <p>
      "Due to cashflow problems and a broad decline in venture capital interest in wearables during 2016, the original company had to shut down late 2016. The assets and cloud service were acquired by a new company called Third Dot, run by some of the former founders and employees, which is keeping the service running for the existing users as well as maintaining sales of the Clip 2. There have been rumours of a Narrative Clip 3 being developed by the new company but no official announcements have been made." - <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Narrative_Clip">Wikipedia</a>
    </p>


    <div style="overflow: auto">
      <p>
      <b>Updates planned by Narrative:</b><br>
      - Shift from sole focus on consumer to business applications<br>
      - Revenue from charging for its cloud service<br>
      - New manufacturing partners to restart production on the Narrative Clip 2<br>
      - A professional version<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Why did Narrative Clip hit hardship in 2016?</b><br>
        Was access to funding more challenging following the privacy concerns raised surrounding Google Glasses? Since that time, Google Glasses have gained traction with manufacturing, where handsfree training occurs during production.  Is the near-term future of wearable sensors in industry?

    <h2>Wearables with Privacy Indicators</h2>


    <div style="float:left"><img src="../img/dataclip/nclip.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 200px; margin-right:30px"></div>

    <h3>A proposed "Five Dot" Privacy Color Coding Standard</h3>

    <br>

    <p><b>Green</b> - non-invasive (privacy protected) data collection</p>
    <p><b>Orange</b> - speech-to-text recording</p>
    <p><b>Red</b> - video and/or audio recording</p>
    <p><b>Purple</b> - spatial data collection. 3D surfaces including faces.</p>
    <p><b>Blue</b> - AI managed spatial data with privacy filters removing biometric data</p>
    <br>

    <h3>Color Combinations:</h3>
    <p>Green and Orange - speech-to-text recording with identity information removed.</p>
    <p>Green and Red - video recording with identity information removed.</p>

    <p>
    Blue is the highest level of privacy ...unless summoned by a court order.

<h2>Wearable Spatial Sensors for Construction</h2>

<p><img src="../img/dataclip/wearable-sensors-7C.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 450px; float:right"></p>

    <p>
      A wide range of optical sensors are anticipated to hold the largest percentage of sensor technology revenue in 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second largest percentage, three-dimensional inertial measurement units (IMU) tracking force and angular rate using accelerometers and gyroscopes, often with magnetometers to provide additional functionality.
    </p>

    <h3>Spatial data collection and exchange</h3>

    <p>[To be added]</p>


    <h3>Object Detection</h3>

    <h2>2018 - New Directions for Wearables</h2>

    <p>
      Google has a new version Wear OS (for their smartwatches and other wearables) which feels less like the Android operating system. (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/08/29/google-wear-os-redesign-2018-hands-on/">engadget.com/2018/08/29</a>)</p><br>

    <p>
      A thin wearable phone could hang like a conference name tag around one's neck. The phone display could face outward to show custom info to passers-by.
