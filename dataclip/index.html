    <h2>What are DataClips?</h2>

    <p>DataClips are wearable devices for capturing audio, photos, video. Some capture additional data from the surrounding environment (temperature, noise level, air quality, etc.). DataClips can record data from multiple vantage points to provide ongoing updates to 3D city models. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The following paper proposes using AI to remove personal identifiers before sharing data within 3D city models.

      Individuals would have the option to access personal data related to themselves and members of their data sharing groups using Privacy-Preserving Face Recognition.[1]&nbsp;<!--  independent of government and private organizations. -->
    
    A committee of peers with multiple decryption keys could decrypt additional data in the event of a crime. 

    <!--
    &nbsp; The shared city data model would generate crowds and traffic 
      approximating the quanities in the original video and 3D spatial photography.--><br>

    <h2><!--A Brief History of -->Public-Facing Mobile Sensors</h2>

    <p>Most mobile sensors worn by individuals track their own biometrics. For example, FitWit records walking and heartrate. The typical mobile sensor doesn't record data from the people and locations around you. In contrast, the following sensors are designed to capture information from your surrounding environment, hands-free.</p><br>

    <p><b>Narrative Clip 2012 to 2016 - Consumer focused "Life-Logging" Camera</b></p>

    <div style="float:right; margin-left:60px"><img src="../img/dataclip/narrative-white-clip2-necklace.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 250px"></div>

    <p>
    The Narrative Clip was initiated in 2012 by a $500,000 kickstarter campaign. The small "life-logging" camera automatically took a picture every 30 seconds.
    Narrative shipped 40,000 units of the Narrative 1 and 2 combined.[2]&nbsp; When the company could not attract further financing in 2016, only pre-ordered Narrative 2 units were delivered. The Narrative Clip 2 was packed with new features: video capture, Bluetooth control, a built-in Wifi cloud uploader and modular attachment system.]<br><br>

    At the peak of it's potential, why was the Narative Clip unable to move forward?
       Narrative's CTO stated that the cashflow problems in 2016 were due to a decline in venture capital for wearables. 

      The assests were acquired by some of the former founders and employees, who are now preparing for a relaunch. [3]

      <!--
       There have been rumours of a Narrative Clip 3 being developed by the new company but no official announcements have been made." - <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Narrative_Clip">Wikipedia</a> (Primary sources to be added.)
      -->
    </p>


    <div style="overflow: auto">
      <p>
      Narrative Clip updates planned for the relaunch:<br>
      - Shift from sole focus on consumer to business applications<br>
      - Adding revenue generation from cloud storage<br>
      - New manufacturing partners<br>
      </p>      
    </div>

    <p>
        Narrative's loss of funding in 2016 may have been partially related to the public privacy outcry surrouding the privacy infingments of Google Glass cameras in restaurants and bars.

        Today Google Glasses have expanded their market within manufacturing, where handsfree training is needed on the factory floor. Narrative may have also been a less appealing investment with emerging competition from simlar clip devices, like the Ion Clip Camera below. Perhaps a rethink of privacy notification and protection is needed before wearing data sensors in public becomes common.

<h2>Wearable Spatial Sensors for Construction</h2>

<p><a href="../img/dataclip/wearable-sensors-7C.jpg"><img src="../img/dataclip/wearable-sensors-7C.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 450px; float:right"></a></p>

    <p>
      With a wide range of sensor technogy being combined in novel ways for 
      new forms of mobile sensor devices, the construction industry has a large set of device categories to draw from.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across 42 different categories of wearable devices, optical sensors are anticipated to hold the largest share of the sensor market in 2022. The second largest percentage is three-dimensional inertial measurement units (IMU) tracking force and angular rate measurement units using accelerometers and gyroscopes, often accompanied by magnetometers to provide additional directional data.

    The second largest percentage is three-dimensional inertial measurement units (IMU) tracking force and angular rate using accelerometers and gyroscopes, often with magnetometers to provide additional functionality.

    </p>

    <p>Optical spatial recording devices that produce contribute to real-time 3D models with A.I. are likely to be the most transformative for the 
      consturction industry, allowing software to update BIM status tracking in real-time. A.I will adjust schedules automatically, request shipments, schedule workers will humans view predictive 3D models to watch for anomolies. 
      Spatial AI could largely replace the use of RFID and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) tags by using high-resolution cameras to identify all objects on the construction site by minute details.
       
    </p>

    <br><br>

    <h2>Mobile Data Collection for Smart City Models</h2>

    <p>
      Beyond the realm of construction sites, the entire city looms as a prospective 
      source of infrastructure sensor data for Digital Twins modeling on an urban scale.[5]&nbsp;

      <!-- for predicting and improving urban outcomes -->
       As mobile sensors capture data from many vantage points to make predictive models more accurate, we'll need to ensure that we don't sacrifice privacy for safety and extreme accuracy.  For example, an array of construction cameras sharing real-time 3D spatial data with all the contractors on the site could significantly increase safety.  Without a means to filter out people passing by from shared videos, construction firms could be revealing the whereabouts of thousands of people to their contractors, making the public walking by the site vulnerable to home break-ins, blackmail or embarrassment if videos are posted online.

    <h2>Device Privacy Protection Indicator Colors</h2>

    <p>How can we indicate the type of data capture underway, so nearby individuals 
    are aware of the degree to which their actions are recorded? 
    Perhaps the existing "red" video recording indicator color could be expanded to include more colors for other types of recording.
    </p>

    <p>At the most basic level, generic data recording (green) would be air quality, humidity and temperature, general counts of people, sound level, etc. At the highest level, another color simultaneous to green, would indicate de-identification of facial features, removing text and audio snippets to protect identity.

    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
    <p>
        Through the use of de-identification, personal mobility devices can be used to contribute data to real-time city models without sacrificing privacy and security. 
        With anonymous retrieval standards, facial recognition services by Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft [8,9] can be used to securely identify individuals prior to removal so they can be provided with encrypted copies of photos and videos of themselves taken by others. Under special circumstances, a group of peers could be granted permission to unlock additional data for solving crimes.
