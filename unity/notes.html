Change when working on PC for MR Toolkit:

Windows-A > For Developers > Development Mode (was Windows Store apps)

When installing VS Community, (under Game development) uncheck Unity 2018 for now. (40.97 GB installed on m3136-taylor-1)



We’re currently working with the last full release,  2017.4.10, note that it targets Unity 2017.x so when you install Unity you’ll want to get the last 2017 version from the archive rather than the newest 2018 one.


5.4.2f2 is likely too new. (First of 2 on PC)

Loren installed 2017.4.10f1 (appears in upper left corner)

Install previous build of HoloLens emulator(10.0.14393.1358).



Pick up here:

Note, 2017.4.10f1 icon on left side of PC desktop.

Skip Android NDK if using Java.

Periodically run the Android SDK Manager to check for the latest SDK revisions.
In Android Studio, click on the SDK Manager icon in the Toolbar.
