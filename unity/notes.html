<h1>Unity for HoloLens Notes</h1>

<h2>Unity Setup in Lab</h2>

  	<pre>
Change when working on PC for MR Toolkit:

Windows (Settings, change view) > Update & Security > For Developers > Development Mode (was "Windows Store" apps)

Message when activating developer mode (as Loren with Abby granting admin permission): 
Developer mode is turned on. However, remote deployment and Windows Device Portal couldn't be found in Windows Update, so they're not available. Error code 0x80004005
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal-desktop

When installing VS Community, (under Game development) uncheck Unity 2018 for now. (40.97 GB installed on m3136-taylor-1)


We're currently working with the last full release,  2017.4.10, note that it targets Unity 2017.x so when you install Unity you’ll want to get the last 2017 version from the archive rather than the newest 2018 one.


5.4.2f2 is likely too new. (First of 2 on PC)

Installed 2017.4.10f1 (appears in upper left corner)

Install previous build of HoloLens emulator(10.0.14393.1358).



Pick up here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install-the-tools

Note, 2017.4.10f1 icon on left side of PC desktop.


David says regarding HoloLens emulator:
If you try to get the video streaming example running you also have to modify a line in MrvcManager.cs, where it says “if (Plugin.IsHoloLens”. you have to remove that check as the emulator will return false for that.

<h2>Unity Android Setup on Mac</h2>

<pre>
/Users/[Username]/Library/Android/sdk

Base directory aka <DEVELOPMENT_ROOT>

/Users/[Username]/Library/Android

To edit rc.common, copy out of /private/etc/ then paste back in. Enter your pw to approve.

It is generally recommended to use the Java API.
Skip Android NDK if using Java.


Vuforia recommends:
Periodically run the Android SDK Manager to check for the latest SDK revisions.
In Android Studio, click on the SDK Manager icon in the Toolbar.
(Third icon from the right.)

Second attempt to request 3D Building access from google on August 18, 2018, also declined used loren@g - Appears that Google is not ready to offer broadly yet.
