<h2>Unity for HoloLens Setup in Lab</h2>

<pre>
Switch your PC into Development Mode:
Windows (Settings, change view) > Update & Security > For Developers > Development Mode 

(was "Windows Store" apps at NDL, was "sideload apps" on bootcamp)  You 

The followng message occured at NDL when activating developer mode, okay to ignore: 
Developer mode is turned on. However, remote deployment and Windows Device Portal couldn't be found in Windows Update, so they're not available. Error code 0x80004005

<h2>Visual Studio</h2>

<a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">Download Visual Studio Community</a> - Free for individual developers, open source projects, academic research, education, and small professional teams.
<!-- Omitted all C++, mobile development with .NET, mobile development with JavaScript -->

WARNNING: If you install Visual Studio on a bootcamp PC emulator on Mac, turn off Hyper-V in Window before restating, otherwise reboot will produce black screen.  Turn off Hyper-V to use Windows 10 on your Mac

<h2>Install Unity 2017.4.10f1</h2>

Use the last full release from the archive, 2017.4.10. Avoid the newer 2018 release. Icon will be added in upper left.

Include:
Windows Store .NET Scripting Backend
Windows Store IL2CPP Scripting Backend

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install-the-tools">Install the Tools - Unity and HoloLens</a>

<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/holograms-100">MR Basics 100: Getting started with Unity</a> - Steps start from chapter 2 video.

File > Build Settings and choose Windows

Edit > Project Settings > Quality (see video)

Edit > Project Settings > Player (see video)
Settings for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) replaced (Settings for Windows Store)
Windows Mixed Reality (replaced the name Windows Holographic)


Enable Virtual Reality Support in Settings and Add Windows Mixed Reality to the devices to use Holographic Emulation.

File > Build Settings > change to Universal Windows Platform, and click Switch Platform.

Now you can choose Window > Holographic Emulation
Switch from none to "Simulate in Editor"

Change the scripting backend to .NET under PlayerSettings
Change VisualStudio to 2015. (Might not be necessary)
Check "Unity C# Projects"

If 'Haptics' error occurs when building from Unity to VS, install the latest Windows 10 sdk:
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk

Build worked, despite saying "Selected Visual Studio [2017] is missing required components and may not be able to build the generated project." (Opening CS 2017 prompted the install of UWP)

Open the App folder and right click the Visual Studio solution file to launch.


<h2>Install Visual Studio Community</h2>Under Game development, uncheck Unity 2018 for now. <!--(40.97 GB installed on m3136-taylor-1)-->

Windows Store IL2CPP Scripting Backend<!--5.4.2f2 is likely too new. (First of 2 on PC)-->

Warning may prevent continuing unless VS 2105 is installed:
Visual Studio 2015 with Update 1 and UWP version 1.2

If VS 2015 license is expired, within initial VS screen log into your gatech account.
<!--
Didn't need to get old license

-->

<h2>HoloLens Emulator</h2>Install previous build of HoloLens emulator(10.0.14393.1358).
(One of two options on page above)

Note from David: If you try to get the video streaming example running you also have to modify a line in MrvcManager.cs, where it says “if (Plugin.IsHoloLens”. you have to remove that check as the emulator will return false for that.
